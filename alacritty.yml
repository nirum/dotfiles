# Configuration for Alacritty, the GPU enhanced terminal emulator.

# Any items in the `env` entry below will be added as
# environment variables. Some entries may override variables
# set by alacritty itself.
env:
  # TERM variable
  #
  # This value is used to set the `$TERM` environment variable for
  # each instance of Alacritty. If it is not present, alacritty will
  # check the local terminfo database and use `alacritty` if it is
  # available, otherwise `xterm-256color` is used.
  TERM: xterm-256color

window:
  padding:
    x: 0

  # Spread additional padding evenly around the terminal content.

  # Window decorations
  #
  # Values for `decorations`:
  #     - full: Borders and title bar
  #     - none: Neither borders nor title bar
  #
  # Values for `decorations` (macOS only):
  #     - transparent: Title bar, transparent background and title bar buttons
  #     - buttonless: Title bar, transparent background, but no title bar buttons

  #
  # Override the variant of the GTK theme. Commonly supported values are `dark` and `light`.
  # Set this to `None` to use the default theme variant.

scrolling:
  # Maximum number of lines in the scrollback buffer.
  # Specifying '0' will disable scrolling.

# Spaces per Tab (changes require restart)
#
# This setting defines the width of a tab in cells.
#
# Some applications, like Emacs, rely on knowing about the width of a tab.
# To prevent unexpected behavior in these applications, it's also required to
# change the `it` value in terminfo when altering this setting.

# Visual Bell
#
# Any time the BEL code is received, Alacritty "rings" the visual bell. Once
# rung, the terminal background will be set to white and transition back to the
# default background color. You can control the rate of this transition by
# setting the `duration` property (represented in milliseconds). You can also
# configure the transition function by setting the `animation` property.
#
# Values for `animation`:
#   - Ease
#   - EaseOut
#   - EaseOutSine
#   - EaseOutQuad
#   - EaseOutCubic
#   - EaseOutQuart

#   - EaseOutExpo

# Specifying a `duration` of `0` will disable the visual bell.
